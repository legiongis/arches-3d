We use digital visualization, 3D virtualization, geospatial informatics, and open access solutions to provide digital data and 3D models to governments, regional institutions, museums, local scholars, and the public. A key element of our mission is the democratization of science-we make all data freely available to the world in support of cultural heritage, heritage management, education, public access, scientific research, and to enhance the digital humanities." %}</p>

While these are often recognized for their heritage value, they are underutilized in science and research because of distance or because the scientific community does not know they exist.' %}

We create online analytical tools to democratize education and research through global analyses and exploration. Our virtual repository approach allows scientific analyses of places, monuments, and collections on a global scale, and provides a mean to highlight the importance of those collections to their communities.' %}

We do this for free. We then return all of the data and results to the host institution or regional/local authorities who can do anything they wish with the materials. All we ask is that we are allowed to publish papers on the project, and to also include the scan data and results on our web site.' %}
